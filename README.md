# Can we assess span-level relevance with dense embedding models?

This is the code repository for the blog post [Can we assess span-level relevance with dense embedding models?](https://onielfa.com/articles/qwen3_span_extraction/).

It contains the jupyter notebook from which the web page was generated, as well as the code for the `manim` animations used in the post.

## How to run the notebook

The project's requirements are in the `pyproject.toml` file. You can install them using any Python package manager, such as `uv`, `poetry`, or `pdm`.

```bash
uv sync
```
or
```bash
poetry install
```
or
```bash
pdm install
```

If you wish to use `pip`, a `requirements.txt` file is also available:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
